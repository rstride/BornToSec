## 📖 About

**Boot2Root** is an information security project from the 42 curriculum where the objective is to gain **root access** on a deliberately vulnerable virtual machine. This project simulates real-world penetration testing scenarios, requiring a methodical approach to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.

### 🎯 Objective

Starting with a vulnerable ISO image, find multiple pathways to compromise the system and escalate privileges to root, documenting each attack vector in detailed writeups.

## 🛠️ Skills Developed

| Category | Skills |
|----------|--------|
| **Reconnaissance** | Network scanning, service enumeration, fingerprinting |
| **Exploitation** | Web app vulnerabilities, service exploitation, reverse engineering |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Kernel exploits, misconfigurations, SUID/GUID abuse |
| **Post-Exploitation** | Persistence, lateral movement, data exfiltration |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **VirtualBox** or **VMware** for running the vulnerable ISO
- **Kali Linux** or similar penetration testing distribution
- Network analysis tools: `nmap`, `netdiscover`, `dirb`
- Exploitation frameworks: `Metasploit`, `Burp Suite`

### Setup

1. Download and import the Boot2Root ISO into your hypervisor
2. Configure network settings (NAT or Host-Only)
3. Boot the vulnerable machine and note its IP address
4. Begin reconnaissance from your attack machine

## 📋 Methodology

```mermaid

    A[🔍 Scanning] --> B[📊 Enumeration]
    B --> C[🎯 Exploitation]
    C --> D[⬆️ Privilege Escalation]
    D --> E[🏆 Root Access]
```

1. **Scanning** - Identify live hosts and open ports
2. **Enumeration** - Discover services, versions, and potential entry points  
3. **Exploitation** - Gain initial foothold on the system
4. **Privilege Escalation** - Escalate from user to root
5. **Documentation** - Record findings in detailed writeups

## 📝 Writeups

| Path | Description | Difficulty |
|------|-------------|------------|
| [Writeup 1](./writeup1) | Primary exploitation vector | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| [Writeup 2](./writeup2) | Alternative attack path | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
